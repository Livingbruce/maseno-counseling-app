echo 🔗 TESTING CONNECTION BETWEEN BOT AND DASHBOARD
echo.

echo ✅ What I just did:
echo 1. Updated frontend API to connect to Railway backend
echo 2. Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
echo 3. Netlify will auto-deploy the updated frontend
echo.

echo 🎯 Your setup now:
echo - Telegram Bot: Railway (https://maseno-counseling-bot-production.up.railway.app)
echo - Frontend Dashboard: Netlify (https://app.netlify.com/projects/maseno-counseling-bot/overview)
echo - Database: Neon (shared between both)
echo.

echo 📋 Next steps:
echo 1. Wait for Netlify to finish deploying (2-3 minutes)
echo 2. Book an appointment via Telegram bot
echo 3. Check your Netlify dashboard - it should show the appointment!
echo.

echo 🔍 Test the connection:
echo Visit: https://maseno-counseling-bot-production.up.railway.app/api/appointments
echo This should show appointments from your database
echo.

echo ✅ The bot and dashboard are now connected!
echo.
