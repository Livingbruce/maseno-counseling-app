- [ ] Check for failed login attempts
- [ ] Review rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Monitor system resources

### **Weekly**
- [ ] Review access patterns
- [ ] Check for suspicious activity
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Test backup procedures

### **Monthly**

## üö® Incident Response Plan

### **Immediate Response (0-1 hour)**
1. [ ] Identify the scope of the incident
2. [ ] Block suspicious IPs if necessary
3. [ ] Reset affected user passwords
4. [ ] Notify security team
5. [ ] Document initial findings

### **Short-term Response (1-24 hours)**
1. [ ] Analyze attack vectors
2. [ ] Identify compromised data
3. [ ] Implement temporary fixes
4. [ ] Notify affected users
5. [ ] Update security measures

### **Long-term Response (1-7 days)**
1. [ ] Complete investigation
2. [ ] Implement permanent fixes
3. [ ] Update security policies
4. [ ] Conduct post-incident review
5. [ ] Improve monitoring

## üìä Security Metrics to Track

### **Authentication Security**
- Failed login attempts per hour
- Password reset requests
- Account lockouts
- Suspicious login patterns

### **API Security**
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Error rates by endpoint
- Response times

### **Data Protection**
- Data access patterns
- Unusual data requests
- File upload attempts
- Database query patterns

### **System Security**
- Server resource usage
- Network traffic patterns
- Error logs
- Performance metrics

## üîß Security Tools & Commands

### **Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Monitor security events
tail -f logs/security.log | grep "Security Event"

# Check failed logins
grep "Failed login" logs/security.log

# Monitor rate limiting
grep "Rate limit exceeded" logs/security.log

# Check AI detections
grep "AI_DETECTED" logs/security.log
```

### **Security Testing**
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login; done

# Test input validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login -d '{"email":"test","password":"123"}'

# Test AI detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/support -d '{"message":"As an AI, I cannot help you"}'
```
