echo 📊 SAVE ISSUES STATUS REPORT
echo.

echo ✅ WORKING:
echo - Announcements: ✅ SAVE WORKS
echo - Appointments: ✅ SAVE WORKS  
echo - Books: ✅ SAVE WORKS
echo.

echo ❌ NOT WORKING:
echo - Activities: ❌ SAVE FAILS (500 error)
echo - Absence Days: ❌ SAVE FAILS (500 error)
echo.

echo 🔍 ROOT CAUSE:
echo The database schema for activities and absence_days tables
echo doesn't match what the API expects. The Railway database
echo has different column structures than what the code assumes.
echo.

echo ✅ WHAT I'VE FIXED:
echo 1. Books now save properly (simplified to use price_cents)
echo 2. Announcements work perfectly
echo 3. Appointments work perfectly
echo 4. All CRUD operations work for working endpoints
echo.

echo ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES:
echo - Activities table schema mismatch
echo - Absence_days table doesn't exist or has wrong structure
echo.

echo 🎯 CURRENT STATUS:
echo Your dashboard can now save:
echo - ✅ New announcements
echo - ✅ New books  
echo - ✅ New appointments
echo - ❌ Activities (still failing)
echo - ❌ Absence days (still failing)
echo.

echo 💡 NEXT STEPS:
echo 1. Test your dashboard with working features
echo 2. Activities and absence days need database schema fixes
echo 3. Most functionality is now working!
echo.
