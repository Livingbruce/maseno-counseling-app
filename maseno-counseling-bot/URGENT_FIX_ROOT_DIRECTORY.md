# üö® URGENT: Fix Root Directory - It's Still Wrong!

## ‚ùå Problem:
It's STILL looking for `/opt/render/project/src/src/index.js` (double src)
This means the root directory is STILL set to `src` instead of `.` (root)

## ‚úÖ Solution:
You MUST change the root directory to `.` (just a dot)

## üìã Do This RIGHT NOW:

### Step 1: Go to Render Settings
1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d36rbtripnbc738hkfv0/deploys/dep-d36rbubipnbc738hkgl0
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**

### Step 2: Fix Root Directory (THIS IS CRITICAL)
1. **Find "Root Directory" section**
2. **Look at what it currently says** - it probably says `src`
3. **Change it to**: `.` (just a dot - this means root directory)
4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Verify Start Command
Make sure the start command is: `node src/index.js`

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
2. **Click "Manual Deploy"**
3. **Wait for deployment**

## üéØ The Root Directory MUST be `.` (dot)

NOT `src` - that's why it's looking for double src!
