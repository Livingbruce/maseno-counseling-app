echo 🔍 DEBUGGING SYNC ISSUE
echo.

echo ✅ What I just did:
echo 1. Added debugging logs to frontend API calls
echo 2. Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
echo 3. Netlify should auto-deploy the updated frontend
echo.

echo 🧪 Debugging Steps:
echo.

echo Step 1: Check if Netlify deployed the latest changes
echo - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/maseno-counseling-bot/overview
echo - Check if there's a new deployment
echo - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
echo.

echo Step 2: Open browser console in your dashboard
echo - Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
echo - Go to Console tab
echo - Refresh the announcements page
echo - Look for these debug messages:
echo   🚀 Making API call to: https://maseno-counseling-bot-production.up.railway.app/dashboard/announcements
echo   📡 API Response status: 200
echo   ✅ API Response data: [data]
echo.

echo Step 3: If you see API calls, check the data
echo - The API should return real data from Railway
echo - If you see mock data, there's still an issue
echo.

echo Step 4: Test creating a new announcement
echo - Create a new announcement in dashboard
echo - Check if it appears in bot
echo - Check console for POST request logs
echo.

echo 🎯 Expected Results:
echo - Console should show API calls to Railway
echo - Data should come from Railway, not mock data
echo - New announcements should sync to bot
echo.

echo 📋 If still not working:
echo 1. Check Netlify deployment status
echo 2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
echo 3. Check console for error messages
echo 4. Verify Railway API is working
echo.
