echo ðŸŽ‰ FINAL FIXED TEST - EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK NOW!
echo.

echo âœ… What I've Fixed:
echo 1. Fixed API connection logic - Railway data now returns properly
echo 2. Added data transformation - Railway data format converted to frontend format
echo 3. Added missing CRUD endpoints to Railway backend:
echo    - DELETE /dashboard/appointments/:id
echo    - POST /dashboard/appointments/:id/cancel
echo    - POST /dashboard/appointments/:id/postpone
echo    - PUT /dashboard/announcements/:id
echo    - DELETE /dashboard/announcements/:id
echo    - PUT /dashboard/books/:id
echo    - DELETE /dashboard/books/:id
echo    - PUT /dashboard/activities/:id
echo    - DELETE /dashboard/activities/:id
echo 4. Deployed updated code to both Railway and Netlify
echo.

echo ðŸ§ª TEST YOUR DASHBOARD NOW:
echo.

echo Step 1: Open Dashboard
echo - Go to: https://maseno-counseling-bot.netlify.app

echo.

echo Step 2: Test Data Display
echo - Appointments should show real data from Railway
echo - Student names should show as @username or Student #ID
echo - All data should come from Railway database
echo.

echo Step 3: Test CRUD Operations
echo - Try deleting an appointment (should work now)

echo Step 4: Test Data Sync
