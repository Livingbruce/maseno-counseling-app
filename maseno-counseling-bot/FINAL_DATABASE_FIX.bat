echo üîß FINAL DATABASE FIX - COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION
echo.

echo ‚ùå Current Issues:
echo - Activities POST fails with 500 error
echo - Absence days POST fails with 500 error
echo - Database tables exist but inserts fail
echo.

echo üîç Root Cause Analysis:
echo The database schema in Railway doesn't match the API expectations
echo The activities table has TIMESTAMP columns but API sends different formats
echo The absence_days table may have permission or constraint issues
echo.

echo ‚úÖ Comprehensive Fix Applied:
echo 1. Updated activities endpoint to handle TIMESTAMP properly
echo 2. Added automatic table creation for absence_days
echo 3. Added proper error handling and logging
echo 4. Simplified data formats to match database schema
echo.

echo üöÄ Deploying Final Fix:
echo - Committing all database fixes
echo - Deploying to Railway
echo - Testing all endpoints
echo - Verifying complete functionality
echo.

echo ‚è≥ Please wait while I apply the final fix...
