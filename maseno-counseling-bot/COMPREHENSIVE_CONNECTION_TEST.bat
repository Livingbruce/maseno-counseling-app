echo üîç COMPREHENSIVE CONNECTION TEST
echo.

echo ‚úÖ What I've Fixed:
echo 1. Fixed API connection logic in frontend
echo 2. Verified Railway backend is working with correct DATABASE_URL
echo 3. Deployed updated code to Netlify
echo 4. Confirmed bot is connected to Railway API
echo.

echo üß™ TESTING STEPS:
echo.

echo Step 1: Test Dashboard Connection
echo - Open: https://maseno-counseling-bot.netlify.app
echo - Press F12 to open browser console
echo - Go to Console tab
echo - Refresh the page
echo - Look for these messages:
echo   üöÄ Making API call to: https://maseno-counseling-bot-production.up.railway.app/dashboard/announcements
echo   üì° API Response status: 200
echo   ‚úÖ API Response data: [real data from Railway database]
echo.

echo Step 2: Test Data Sync
echo - Create a new announcement in dashboard
echo - Check if it appears in your Telegram bot
echo - The announcement should be saved to Railway database
echo.

echo Step 3: Verify Database Connection
echo - Railway is using: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_mxctpnL51sTU@ep-withered-shape-abox0wby-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb
echo - Bot is connected to: https://maseno-counseling-bot-production.up.railway.app
echo - Dashboard is connected to: https://maseno-counseling-bot-production.up.railway.app
echo.

echo Step 4: Test Complete Flow
echo 1. Create announcement in dashboard ‚Üí Should save to Railway DB
echo 2. Bot fetches from Railway API ‚Üí Should show new announcement
echo 3. All data should be synchronized
echo.

echo üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS:
echo - Dashboard shows real data from Railway database
echo - No more mock data or "Welcome" announcements
echo - New announcements sync to bot immediately
echo - All CRUD operations work with Railway backend
echo.

echo ‚ö†Ô∏è If still not working:
echo 1. Clear browser cache completely (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
echo 2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
echo 3. Check console for any error messages
echo 4. Verify the API calls are going to Railway (not localhost)
echo.

echo ‚úÖ The connection should now be working perfectly!
echo.
